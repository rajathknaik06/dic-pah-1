""" Write a program that takes user input, analyzes the text, and identifies the most frequent word(s) along with their respective counts.



The program shold remove the punctuation marks such as .,?!;:"() from the input text, then output the top N most frequent words and save the result to an output file called "output.txt".

Input format :
The input consists of string S, representing the text entered by the user. The text contains words separated by spaces and may contain punctuation marks.

Output format :
The output displays "'X' with a count of Y" where X is the most frequent word and Y is the count."""
